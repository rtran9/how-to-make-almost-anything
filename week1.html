      If you don't know what a star light projector, look it up!

      Here's something you can buy from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lizber-Night-Projector-Degree-Rotation/dp/B01CFI082Y?th=1">amazon</a>.

      Basically it is a lamp encased inside a fixture so that when you turn off the lights in your room stars project onto the walls.

      I came across an idea when looking at shadow art. For example, here's a <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/62Fal">gallery</a> of cool art.

      I want to expand on these ideas. The idea is to have a thing that can take any image input and be able to project the image onto a wall.
      There are three main parts to this: 1) transforming any image to a shadow form, 2) creating a lattice of small cells that can rotate / contract, 3) controlling the lattice by a program.

      Upon further review, I will not be doing this project.
