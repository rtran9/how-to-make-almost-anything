    <p>
      I followed the guide <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.16/doc/projects/ftsmin/index.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The specific milling machine i used was a Roland SRM-20.
    </p>

    <p>
      The endmills used were 1/64in for tracing and 1/32in for cutting.
    </p>

    <p>
      My first few attempts actually failed. :(
    </p>

    <p>
      The endmill on the first one above seemed to not be calibrated correctly. Some time later I tried again. In the second one, the endmill seemed to have gone bad and wasn't able to cut properly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the one of my good attempts.
    </p>

    <p>
      As per advice, I used a utility knife to remove the copper on the end. note the difference on the left.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next step was to solder all the pieces onto the board.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once connected, the red led should light up!
    </p>

    <img src="assets/img/week3/connect.jpg">

    <p>
      On my first try at connecting board, the led didn't light. It turns out I had soldered the LEDs on backwards. oops. Good thing I had also just learned how to remove solder.
    </p>

    <p>
      I then followed the guide to properly program the board.
